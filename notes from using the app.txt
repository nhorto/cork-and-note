1. need to move overall rating to bottom of model. 
    1. since when you are talking about a wine you would want to give it a overall rating last. 
2. figure out what would happen if you go to a winery multiple times and log notes about the winery. im sure 
    what would happen when you do this. and im not talking about notes about the wine. im talking about notes about the winery
3. i get a error when creating a custom tasting note. i just tried to do it and it gave me this error: 
     ERROR  Error creating flavor note: {"code": "42501", "details": null, "hint": null, "message": 
        "new row violates row-level security policy for table \"flavor_notes\""}
4. 


add in help button on the map
maybe make it to where the winery id tab is not a model but a page or something like that 
look at the filters for the wine tab. if you have had a lot of different wines or been to a lot of different wineries, it gets 
    really long and you have to scroll to the side a lot for this.
